# embedding_notebooks
These are Jupyter notebooks to accompany "The Embedding Method for Electronic Structure", by John E. Inglesfield.
This ebook is published by IOP Publishing, Bristol, UK, ISBN 978-0-7503-1042-0 as part of the *Expanding Physics*  book program.

The notebooks contain Python programs which can be run interactively, to illustrate various aspects of the embedding method. They will reproduce various models used in the book, and by varying parameters you can see how the embedding method works.

**The following Python modules are needed**: numpy, scipy, matplotlib.
